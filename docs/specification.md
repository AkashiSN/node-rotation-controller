# node-rotation-controller — Specification

Functional specification for a Kubernetes controller that proactively rotates Karpenter-managed nodes in a make-before-break (surge) fashion within a configurable maintenance window, before Karpenter's forceful `expireAfter` is triggered.

Japanese translation: [docs/ja/specification.md](ja/specification.md)

---

## 1.1 Background

Karpenter (and EKS Auto Mode, which is built on Karpenter) classifies node disruption into two categories:

| Category | Examples | NodePool Disruption Budgets | Pre-provisioned replacement | PDB |
|----------|----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----|
| Graceful | Drift, Consolidation | Applied | Yes (make-before-break) | Strictly respected |
| **Forceful** | **Expiration**, Spot Interruption | **Not applied** | **No** | Respected, but capped by `terminationGracePeriod` |

Expiration is intentionally classified as forceful so that AMI patches and security-critical updates cannot be indefinitely delayed by misconfigured budgets or PDBs. This rationale is documented in the upstream Karpenter design [`forceful-expiration.md`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/karpenter/blob/main/designs/forceful-expiration.md), which explicitly identifies "operators implement their own graceful rotation" as an acceptable solution path. EKS Auto Mode further enforces a **21-day maximum node lifetime** that users can *reduce* but not remove — nodes have "a maximum lifetime of 21 days … after which they are automatically replaced" ([EKS Auto Mode user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/automode.html)). Because a node's true end-of-life is its `expireAfter` expiry **plus** up to `terminationGracePeriod` of drain, this ceiling is enforced as a constraint on their **sum**: `expireAfter + terminationGracePeriod ≤ 21d` (AWS states the sum "cannot exceed 21 days" — [AWS builders.flash, 2025-04](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/builders-flash/202504/dive-deep-eks-node-automated-update/)). For reference, the Auto Mode defaults are `expireAfter` 336h (≈14d) and `terminationGracePeriod` 24h ([Create a Node Pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-pool.html)).

The practical consequence: in any non-trivial cluster, nodes **will be force-drained at unpredictable times**, regardless of PDB settings, and Karpenter will only begin provisioning a replacement *after* the drain starts. For latency-sensitive workloads with strict capacity requirements (e.g., `request == limit`), this creates a window of forced pod-pending that can collide with peak business hours.

## 1.2 Goals

| # | Goal |
|---|------|
| G1 | **Prevent forceful Expiration from firing in practice** by replacing `NodeClaim` resources that approach an age threshold (derived per NodePool from the maintenance schedule and a target number of rotation chances — see §3.2) during a defined maintenance window, using the voluntary disruption path |
| G2 | **Eliminate the pending-pod window** by adding a NodePool-owned replacement node first and waiting for it to be `Ready` before deleting the old one (node-level surge / make-before-break; Pod-level ordering is delegated to PDB — see §3.3) |
| G3 | **Confine rotation to business-safe time slots** via a configurable maintenance window (weekday / time-of-day / timezone) |
| G4 | **Compose with existing protections** — PDB, `topologySpreadConstraints`, preStop hooks, Pod Readiness Gates, ALB slow start — without replacing them |

## 1.3 Non-Goals

| # | Non-Goal | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| N1 | Replace Karpenter Consolidation / Drift | Karpenter's autonomous optimization remains active and beneficial. Only the Expiration path is taken over |
| N2 | Handle Spot interruption | Spot interruption is an AWS-side event with a 2-minute hard limit; use [AWS Node Termination Handler](https://github.com/aws/aws-node-termination-handler) |
| N3 | Application-side warm-up | JVM warm-up, connection pool priming, and similar concerns belong to `readinessProbe` / `readinessGate` / ALB slow start. The controller orchestrates *node* placement; the application orchestrates its own readiness. A v3 hook for synthetic warm-up jobs is reserved for the future |
| N4 | Allow `expireAfter == 0` or removal of the 21-day hard cap | The Auto Mode cap cannot be bypassed. `expireAfter` is intentionally kept as a backstop in case the controller is unavailable |
| N5 | OS-patch reboot orchestration | Out of scope; see [kured](https://github.com/kubereboot/kured) |

## 1.4 Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **NodeClaim** | Karpenter v1 CRD; a 1:1 representation of an underlying instance (e.g., EC2) |
| **surge** | Creating a replacement node and waiting until it is `Ready` before draining the old one (make-before-break) |
| **maintenance window** | The **union** of one or more configured weekday/time-of-day ranges during which the controller may *start* a rotation. In-flight rotations are allowed to complete past the window boundary |
| **age threshold** | The `creationTimestamp` age beyond which a `NodeClaim` becomes a rotation candidate. **Derived** per NodePool from the schedule and the target rotation chances (`minRotationChances`), not set directly (§3.2). The actual per-node trigger anchors on each NodeClaim's own `spec.expireAfter` deadline; `ageThreshold` is its age-equivalent representative (§3.2) |
| **backstop** | Karpenter's native `expireAfter` (Forceful Expiration), which still fires if the controller is unavailable. Intentionally retained as a safety net |

## 1.5 Position in the Karpenter Ecosystem

This controller is intentionally aligned with upstream Karpenter's design direction. It does not attempt to alter Karpenter's behavior; instead it operates in a layer above.

### Why upstream will not absorb this functionality

The Karpenter design [`forceful-expiration.md`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/karpenter/blob/main/designs/forceful-expiration.md) records the deliberate decision to keep Expiration forceful. It lists three options for users who want graceful expiration semantics:

1. (Recommended by upstream) Keep Expiration forceful as-is
2. Add a per-NodePool `expirationPolicy: Forceful | Graceful` field
3. **"Operators implement their own graceful rotation"**

This controller is option 3. Because upstream has explicitly identified user-side implementation as a legitimate solution, the risk of this project being made redundant by upstream absorption is low.

### Why Disruption Budgets are not sufficient

Karpenter's `NodePool.spec.disruption.budgets` supports `schedule + duration`, which superficially looks like a maintenance window. In practice it has two structural limitations:

| Requirement | Achievable with vanilla Karpenter? |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| Allow disruption only inside a window, deny outside | △ Only via blacklisting (set `nodes: "0"` outside the window via multiple budgets), because the budget algorithm takes the *minimum* across overlapping budgets — see [Discussion #1079](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/karpenter/discussions/1079) |
| Apply the window to Expiration | ✗ Budgets apply to Consolidation/Drift only, **not to Expiration** |
| Surge replacement during Expiration | ✗ Expiration is forceful; no pre-provisioning |

This controller fills the second and third rows above and substantially simplifies the first.

### Adjacent projects

| Project | Scope | Overlap |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Karpenter NodePool Disruption Budgets | Rate-limit Drift/Consolidation | Complementary; not applicable to Expiration |
| [kured](https://github.com/kubereboot/kured) | Reboot nodes for OS patching | None; doesn't manipulate NodeClaims |
| [AWS Node Termination Handler](https://github.com/aws/aws-node-termination-handler) | Spot interruption / scheduled events | None; different trigger |
| [descheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler) | Pod rebalancing | None; doesn't touch nodes |
| EKS Node Auto Repair (AWS managed) | Replace unhealthy nodes | None; not expiration-driven |

---

## 2.1 Scope and Compatibility

### Supported environments

| Environment | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| EKS Auto Mode | Primary target (the 21-day hard cap is the strongest motivating constraint) |
| Self-managed Karpenter v1+ on EKS | Supported |
| Karpenter on other CNCF distributions (AKS NAP, etc.) | Best-effort; CRD API is the same but operator semantics may differ |

### Karpenter API version

`karpenter.sh/v1` is required. Earlier versions (`v1beta1`, `v1alpha5`) are not supported.

## 2.2 Composition with Existing Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| Karpenter Consolidation / Drift | **Coexists.** This controller takes over only the Expiration path. Voluntary disruption from Consolidation/Drift still flows through Karpenter |
| NodePool `expireAfter` | **Coexists** as backstop. The derived `ageThreshold` sits below `expireAfter` by construction (`A = E − (K·P + t_rot)`, §3.2), and validation fails (**fatal**) when the schedule cannot guarantee the configured rotation chances — the gap is not hand-tuned |
| NodePool `terminationGracePeriod` | **Depended on.** After the controller deletes an old `NodeClaim`, Karpenter's termination controller honors PDBs during drain, bounded by `terminationGracePeriod` |
| PodDisruptionBudget | **Depended on.** Drain after the controller's `NodeClaim` deletion follows the voluntary path, so PDBs are strictly respected |
| `topologySpreadConstraints` | **Depended on.** Even with surge, all pods on a node disappear together when that node is finally drained. Spreading remains essential |

---

## 3.1 Maintenance Window

```yaml
maintenanceWindows:        # a list; the effective window is the UNION of all entries
  - timezone: Asia/Tokyo   # IANA tz database name
    days: [Wed, Sat]       # ISO weekday names: Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Fri/Sat/Sun
    start: "02:00"
    end:   "06:00"
```

**Semantics**:

- The reconciler is **always running**; window membership is evaluated on each reconcile tick (1-minute Ticker).
- `maintenanceWindows` is a **list**; the effective maintenance window is the **union** of all entries. This lets operators combine schedules (e.g., a weekday slot plus a weekend slot) to increase rotation frequency.
- Outside the (union) window the reconcile loop is a no-op.
- The window controls only **rotation starts**. An in-flight rotation continues past the window boundary (aborting mid-drain is more dangerous than letting it complete).
- A single `NodePool` may be **frozen** by an annotation (e.g., `noderotation.io/freeze=<RFC3339 timestamp>`) to suppress rotation until that time (use case: business-critical periods).

The **worst-case window period `P`** — the largest gap between the start of one window occurrence and the start of the next over the recurring cycle — is derived from this union and feeds the `ageThreshold` derivation in §3.2. For example, the union `{Wed 02:00, Sat 02:00}` has gaps `Wed→Sat = 3d` and `Sat→Wed = 4d`, so `P = 4d`.

> **Note (DST).** `P` is computed over the recurring **wall-clock** cycle. A daylight-saving transition can shift an individual gap by ±1h; v1 treats this as a known approximation and does not special-case it.

## 3.2 Candidate Selection

A `NodeClaim` becomes a rotation candidate when **all** of the following hold:

| Condition | Default | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `now() > deadline − leadTime`, where `deadline = NodeClaim.metadata.creationTimestamp + NodeClaim.spec.expireAfter` and `leadTime = K·P + t_rot` | `leadTime` is **derived** (see below), not set directly | Anchored on each NodeClaim's **own** `spec.expireAfter` (its authoritative expiry), **not** the NodePool template. The derived `ageThreshold` is the age-equivalent of this trigger; defaults to `auto`, an explicit override is allowed but still validated |
| Belongs to a `NodePool` matched by the configured selector | Required | A `NodePool` matched by `nodepoolSelectors` is in scope |
| `status.conditions[Ready] == True` | Required | NotReady NodeClaims are skipped — an already-unhealthy node is left to EKS Node Auto Repair and the `expireAfter` backstop, not rotated here (the controller only owns the health of nodes it created during a surge) |
| `metadata.annotations["noderotation.io/state"]` is empty, or `failed` past its escalated backoff | Required | `pending`/`draining` are in-flight and driven by §5.2 step 1, not re-selected here; `failed` is retried after an **escalating** backoff (doubling per consecutive failure, §5.3) |

When multiple claims are eligible they are sorted by age (oldest first).

### Deriving `ageThreshold` from the desired rotation chances

Rather than hand-tuning `ageThreshold` (which is error-prone — a too-loose value lets Forceful Expiration fire before a window arrives), the controller **derives it per NodePool** from the schedule and a target number of rotation chances.

> **This is the central race.** Forceful Expiration fires at each node's `deadline` regardless of maintenance windows or PDBs, so the controller must *finish* a graceful surge rotation **before** that moment — every cycle. Candidate selection **is** that lookahead: a node is selected once its `deadline` falls within `leadTime = K·P + t_rot` of now (equivalently, `age > ageThreshold`). Read `leadTime` left to right — `K` worst-case window cycles (`K·P`) to *catch* a window, plus one node's completion time (`t_rot`) to *finish* inside it — and it guarantees the node sees at least `K` maintenance windows with enough headroom to complete before `expireAfter` can fire. `K ≥ 2` keeps a retry in hand if a window is missed or slow. The derivation below picks the largest such threshold so rotation still happens as late as safely possible.

**Symbols**

| Symbol | Meaning | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `E` | `expireAfter` | Per-node: **`NodeClaim.spec.expireAfter`** (authoritative; anchored at the NodeClaim's `creationTimestamp`). NodePool `spec.template.spec.expireAfter` is used only as the **representative** for per-NodePool validation/logging — it does **not** propagate to existing NodeClaims (see note below) |
| `tGP` | `terminationGracePeriod` | Per-node: `NodeClaim.spec.terminationGracePeriod`; NodePool `spec.template.spec.terminationGracePeriod` as the representative |
| `P` | worst-case window period (largest gap between consecutive window occurrences) | derived from the `maintenanceWindows` union (§3.1) |
| `t_rot` | upper bound on a single node's rotation time = `readyTimeout + tGP + buffer` (**`cooldownAfter` is not included** — the node is already drained before the cooldown; see the margin note below) | derived from config + NodePool |
| `K` | desired guaranteed rotation chances (`minRotationChances`) | user-set; floor **1** |

**Derivation** — pick the *largest* threshold that still guarantees `K` completable chances inside `[ageThreshold, E)`, so rotation happens as late as safely possible (minimizing churn and surge cost):

```
ageThreshold (A) = E − (K·P + t_rot)
```

This holds because the usable interval `[A, E − t_rot]` then spans at least `K` window occurrences in the worst phase (`floor(((E − t_rot) − A) / P) ≥ K`), each with `t_rot` of headroom to complete before `E`.

> **Margin.** The bound is **tight**: the worst-phase guarantee is *exactly* `K` (`floor(K·P / P) = K`), with no built-in slack. Any safety margin must therefore come from `K` itself — `K ≥ 2` is recommended so a single missed or slow window still leaves a retry. `cooldownAfter` is the settle pause *between* consecutive rotations within a window; it does **not** count toward a single node's completion time (`t_rot`, which is why it was removed above) but it **does** factor into throughput (layer 2 below).

> **Authoritative expiry source.** The deadline that drives the *per-node* trigger is read from each **`NodeClaim.spec.expireAfter`**, anchored at that NodeClaim's `creationTimestamp` — **not** from the NodePool's `spec.template.spec.expireAfter`. Karpenter stamps `expireAfter` onto the NodeClaim at creation, and Forceful Expiration fires at `creationTimestamp + NodeClaim.spec.expireAfter`. Later edits to the NodePool template do **not** propagate to existing NodeClaims; they only trigger drift-based replacement. The controller therefore anchors `leadTime` on each node's own `deadline`, and uses the template `E` solely as the **representative** value for the per-NodePool startup validation and the logged/derived `ageThreshold` (§4.2). When a node's own `spec.expireAfter` differs from the template (e.g. mid-drift, or after a template change), its trigger follows its own value — so the identity `now() > deadline − leadTime ⟺ age > ageThreshold` holds exactly only when the two coincide.

**Validation** (layer 1 — scheduling feasibility)

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| `K < 1` | **fatal** — invalid config |
| `K < 2` (i.e. `K = 1`) | **warn** — a single missed/failed window leaves no retry before Forceful Expiration |
| `A ≤ 0` (i.e. `E ≤ K·P + t_rot`; the schedule cannot guarantee even `K` chances) | **fatal** — raise `E` (Auto Mode allows up to `21d − tGP`), add window occurrences to shrink `P`, or lower `K`. Note that raising the template `E` heals **new** NodeClaims only — existing ones keep their stamped value and are surfaced by the per-node check (layer 3 below) until they rotate out |
| `0 < A < P` (a node becomes a candidate before it has lived even one window period) | **warn** — extremely aggressive: nodes rotate very young, maximizing churn/surge cost. Raise `E` or lower `K` |
| Auto Mode and `E + tGP > 21d` | **warn** — violates the hard cap |
| `tGP` unset (self-managed Karpenter allows nil) | **warn** — the drain phase is then unbounded by Karpenter (a blocking PDB or stuck finalizer can hold it forever); the §5.2 stuck-drain alert falls back to a fixed bound |
| `retryBackoff < readyTimeout` | **warn** — a failed attempt runs for up to `readyTimeout` before rolling back, so a shorter base backoff lets retries repeat the failed-surge cost (§4.4) faster than a single attempt even lasts. The per-attempt `started-at` re-stamp (§5.3) keeps retries *correct* regardless; the configuration just defeats the cost-bounding intent of the escalating backoff. The defaults (30m vs 15m) satisfy this |
| NodePool `spec.limits` resource budget (`{cpu, memory, …}`) leaves no room for the surge node's requests (the headroom for one more node is exhausted) | **warn** — surge cannot land without free budget; raise `limits` to leave headroom for one node's worth of resources. The controller re-checks this at rotation start (§5.2) |

**Validation** (layer 2 — throughput) — independent of the derivation; it only **warns** and never changes `A`. Because rotations are serial within a window and separated by `cooldownAfter` (enforced as a per-NodePool start gate in §5.2 step 2), each window occurrence of duration `D` can rotate `C = m · floor(D / (t_rot + cooldownAfter))` nodes (`m = surge.maxUnavailable`, fixed at `1` in v1). This bound is deliberately **conservative**: the window gates only rotation *starts* (§3.1), so one further rotation can typically start near the window's edge and complete past it — the formula ignores that final start, erring toward a warning. If the candidate arrival rate exceeds capacity (`C < N · P / A`, where `N` is the NodePool node count), candidates accumulate and some may reach Forceful Expiration:

- **warn**: widen windows (larger `D`), add occurrences (smaller `P`), or raise `maxUnavailable` (reserved for a later version).

**Validation** (layer 3 — per-node, runtime) — the two layers above use the NodePool **template** `E`/`tGP` as representatives, but the actual trigger is per-NodeClaim (*Authoritative expiry source* above), so a passing template does not prove every *existing* claim is satisfiable — e.g. after the template `E` was raised to clear a fatal, the already-stamped claims still carry the short value. On each reconcile the controller therefore also checks every in-scope NodeClaim against its **own** `spec.expireAfter`: a claim with `E_node ≤ K·P + t_rot` (per-node `A ≤ 0`) can no longer be guaranteed `K` chances — it is counted in `noderotation_short_lead_nodes` (§4.2), warned via an event, and rotated **best-effort at the earliest opportunity** (by the trigger above it is already a candidate).

> **Worked example.** Auto Mode, `E = 14d`, `tGP = 1h`, union `{Wed, Sat} 02:00–06:00` → `P = 4d`, `t_rot ≈ 1.5h` (`readyTimeout 15m + tGP 1h + buffer`), `K = 2`. Then `A = 14d − (2·4d + 1.5h) ≈ 5.9d`: nodes become candidates at ~5.9d and are guaranteed 2 windows before 14d. Throughput `C = floor(4h / (1.5h + 10m)) = 2` per occurrence (conservative — a third rotation can still *start* before the window closes and complete past it, §3.1).
>
> A **weekly-only** window `{Sat}` has `P = 7d`, so `A = 14d − (2·7d + 1.5h) ≈ −1.5h ≤ 0` → **fatal**: weekly windows cannot guarantee 2 chances at `E = 14d`. This is exactly why a fixed `expireAfter − 4d` default was unsafe; the derivation surfaces it and tells the operator to raise `E` (to ~`20d`, giving `A ≈ 6d`) or add a window day. (Raising `E` takes effect for **new** NodeClaims only; the already-stamped ones are caught by the layer-3 per-node check until they rotate out.)

The derived `A`, the guaranteed chances `G`, and `P` are surfaced per NodePool via startup logs and metrics (§4.2). With the auto-derivation, `G = K` by construction; the separate `G` exists so that when an explicit `ageThreshold` override is used, `G` is **recomputed from that override** and can be observed diverging from the requested `K`.

## 3.3 Surge Sequence (v1)

A single reconcile cycle handles **one** node. v1 enforces serial processing **per NodePool** (`surge.maxUnavailable = 1`) to minimize blast radius; distinct NodePools may rotate concurrently.

### Surge into the *same* NodePool — not a standalone node

The replacement node must belong to the **same NodePool** as the node being replaced. The controller therefore does **not** rotate by creating a standalone `NodeClaim`. (A standalone NodeClaim *is* provisionable — see §7.2 — but the resulting node has no NodePool owner, so its pods would persist on an unmanaged node that sits outside NodePool accounting, expiry, drift, and disruption budgets. In a cluster that deliberately separates NodePools, e.g. `api` vs `batch`, that is unacceptable.)

Instead, the controller induces Karpenter to add a NodePool-owned node by creating a temporary **placeholder Pod** — a single low-priority "pause" Pod that the controller **creates and manages directly** (deliberately *not* via a Deployment/ReplicaSet/Job). Its scheduling requirements are copied from the **candidate node** — most importantly the AZ (`topology.kubernetes.io/zone`), plus the arch / instance-type / capacity-type constraints the rescheduled Pods depend on (see *Stateful and zonal workloads* below) — and its resource requests are set to the **sum of the resource requests of the *reschedulable* Pods currently scheduled on the candidate node** — the workload that must re-land after the drain. This sum **excludes** Pods that Karpenter does not need to re-fit onto fresh capacity: **DaemonSet** Pods (kube-proxy, CNI, CSI, log shippers, …) — Karpenter already adds the DaemonSet overhead to *every* new node it provisions, so counting them here would **double-count** and over-provision — plus mirror/static Pods, completed (`Succeeded`/`Failed`) Pods, and Pods pinned to this specific node (e.g. by hostname affinity) that cannot re-land elsewhere. A required `nodeAffinity` (`kubernetes.io/hostname NotIn {…}`) additionally excludes the **candidate node itself** — Pod anti-affinity matches *Pods*, not nodes, so hostname exclusion is the mechanism that can rule out a specific node — along with **every node already past its own rotation trigger** (its NodeClaim's `deadline` within `leadTime`, §3.2): the placeholder must never reserve space on the very node about to be drained, nor absorb onto a host that is itself about to expire or be rotated next — that reservation would evaporate at the host's force-expiry, and the displaced Pods would be re-drained on the very next rotation. Sized this way, the placeholder forces Karpenter to provision a new node *within that NodePool* — in the same zone and large enough to host that workload — **whenever existing spare capacity cannot absorb it**. If the scheduler instead bin-packs the placeholder onto *pre-existing* spare capacity, that is equally acceptable (the **capacity-absorb path**): the placeholder is then *reserving* exactly the displaced workload's worth of existing headroom, so the drain is just as safe without a new node. This is the normal outcome for DaemonSet-heavy or low-utilization candidates whose reschedulable sum is small — nodes that would otherwise be structurally unable to rotate, since no sizing could force a new node for them. Either way, the node the placeholder lands on (the **surge target**) is frozen for the duration of the rotation (see *Guarding against mid-surge disruption* below); once the old node is drained, the placeholder is removed and the surge target remains a normal member of the NodePool.

Because the placeholder is a **bare Pod** (not backed by any controller) and is low-priority, when the rescheduled workload Pods need its space the scheduler **preempts** it and the placeholder is simply **deleted with no replacement**. (A Deployment/Job-backed pod would instead be recreated and re-pend, inducing extra node churn — which is exactly why a bare, controller-managed Pod is used.) Its only role is to reserve one node's worth of capacity until the drain lands the real Pods on it.

**Placeholder priority.** The placeholder runs under a **dedicated `PriorityClass`** with a **negative value** (`globalDefault: false`, below the `0` of normal workloads and far below the system-critical classes), and with `preemptionPolicy: Never`. This makes it the deliberate preemption *victim*: the rescheduled workload (priority `≥ 0`) preempts it as described above, while the placeholder itself **never** preempts real workloads or system-critical Pods: while pending it never evicts any existing Pod to make room — it either fits into genuinely *free* pre-existing capacity (the capacity-absorb path above) or waits for Karpenter to add a node. **Caveat — preemption is not exclusive to the rescheduled workload.** A negative priority makes the placeholder *maximally* preemptible, so the priority value alone cannot stop an **unrelated higher-priority pending Pod** from preempting it mid-surge (before the drain has even produced the workload it is holding space for). If that happens, the state machine observes the placeholder missing and recreates it (the pending handler's idempotent re-assertion, §5.2). This loop is **bounded, not perpetual**: the entire `pending` phase is capped by `readyTimeout`, after which the rotation **rolls back** and degrades to the `expireAfter` baseline (§3.3 *Rollback*) — so even a sustained hostile-preemption scenario self-terminates into a clean failure rather than churning forever.

### Guarding against mid-surge disruption

While the old and new nodes coexist, Karpenter's Consolidation/Drift could race the controller:

- the **new** node, briefly underutilized, could be judged "empty/underutilized" and consolidated away immediately;
- the **old** node could be consolidated/drifted before the controller has finished orchestrating, or be chosen for removal ahead of the intended order.

To prevent both, the controller applies `karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt` to **both** the old node and the surge target (the node the placeholder landed on — newly provisioned or, on the capacity-absorb path, pre-existing) for the duration of the surge, and marks each frozen node with `noderotation.io/surge-for=<old NodeClaim name>` so its freeze is attributable to this rotation (§5.3) — the marker is what lets the controller find the surge target again after the old NodeClaim is gone, and what distinguishes its own `do-not-disrupt` from one applied by an operator. Per Karpenter's documented semantics, this annotation blocks only **voluntary disruption** (Consolidation, Drift, Emptiness) — it does **not** exclude a node from the *forceful* methods: **Forceful Expiration (`expireAfter`)**, Interruption, or Node Repair. (Confirmed in the Karpenter `nodeclaim/expiration` controller, which deletes an expired NodeClaim the moment `creationTimestamp + expireAfter` is reached without ever consulting the annotation; the node-level `do-not-disrupt` check lives solely on the voluntary candidate-selection path.) Winning the race against Forceful Expiration is therefore **not** this annotation's job — that is handled structurally by the `leadTime` sizing in §3.2, which selects each node early enough to finish a graceful surge **before** its `deadline`. The annotation's role here is narrower but still essential: it stops Karpenter's own optimizer from consolidating or drifting the half-built surge pair out from under the controller. The controller's own explicit `delete` of the old NodeClaim drains it through the voluntary (termination-controller) path regardless of the annotation. The annotations are removed at the end so the new node rejoins normal management. (**Residual risk:** because the annotation does **not** extend the old node's life, if its `deadline` arrives while the surge is still waiting for the replacement to become `Ready`, Karpenter force-expires the old node on schedule — landing the rescheduled Pods on capacity that may not yet exist. This is a tight-`leadTime` / last-window edge case; it degrades to the native baseline rather than being prevented — see §3.5. The **surge target's** own `deadline` is handled structurally instead: the placeholder's hostname exclusion above keeps it off any node already within `leadTime` of its own deadline, so a surge target always has far more remaining life than one rotation needs.)

The diagram below is the **logical** sequence of one rotation. It is **not** executed as a single blocking call: the controller implements it as a **non-blocking, requeue-driven state machine** (§5.2), persisting progress in the `noderotation.io/state` annotation on the old NodeClaim and anchoring the rotation itself in the `noderotation.io/active-rotation` annotation on the NodePool, with `noderotation.io/active-rotation-state` mirroring whether the rotation has reached `draining` — the anchor **outlives the old NodeClaim**, which is deleted when the rotation succeeds, and is what drives the completion step and its outcome (§5.3). Each `wait_*` step is therefore *a state that is re-evaluated on subsequent reconciles*, not a goroutine that blocks a worker. The `[state: …]` tags map each step to the state annotation.

```

```

> The placeholder's only job is to reserve exactly one node's worth of capacity ahead of the drain (make-before-break). Its requests are sized to the **sum of the candidate node's *reschedulable* Pod requests** (excluding DaemonSet, mirror, completed, and node-pinned Pods — see §3.3 above), so Karpenter launches a *new* node whenever existing spare capacity cannot fit it. The guard that protects the drain is **physical reservation**: `surge_ready` requires the placeholder to be *Running* on a *Ready* node **other than the candidate** (the hostname `nodeAffinity` exclusion already rules out the candidate at scheduling time). Whether that host is newly provisioned or pre-existing (the capacity-absorb path above), its admission means the reschedulable workload's worth of capacity is now physically held — so the old node is never deleted without real headroom in place. One honesty note on the **absorb** path: there the reservation is an **aggregate** — one node's worth of summed requests held on a host that already runs other Pods — so an individual displaced Pod can still fail to use it even when nominal headroom exists (pod anti-affinity against the resident Pods, `hostPort` collisions, …). This is the same pod-level disclaimer as *Pod-level behavior* below: the controller guarantees node-level capacity; per-Pod placement remains the scheduler's and the PDB's domain. Whether the host's `creationTimestamp` postdates `started-at` is still recorded (event/metrics) to distinguish a true surge from capacity absorption, but it is observability, not a gate. Because these requests define the surge node's resource footprint, they are also what the `surge_headroom` pre-check (§5.2) tests against the NodePool's remaining `spec.limits` resource budget (conservative: the capacity-absorb path consumes no new budget, but v1 still requires the headroom before starting). The exact request padding **and the precise exclusion filter** (DaemonSet / mirror / completed / node-pinned) are finalized in the PoC.

### Pod-level behavior — node-level make-before-break only

The make-before-break in this design is at the **node** level, not the Pod level. The controller does **not** perform a rolling update of Pods: it does not pre-create new Pods on the surge node before terminating the old ones. The surge node is added as **empty capacity**.

When the old `NodeClaim` is deleted, Karpenter's termination controller drains the old node through the **Eviction API** (PDBs respected). Each evicted Pod is deleted, and its owning workload controller (Deployment/ReplicaSet/StatefulSet) creates a **replacement Pod** that the scheduler then places onto available capacity — typically the surge node. This is fundamentally **evict-then-reschedule**, so a replacement Pod is *not* guaranteed to be `Ready` before the old Pod terminates (see §4.1).

The surge node's role is therefore to **pre-stage a landing zone** so that PDB-gated eviction proceeds without a long pending window — not to order Pods. Pod-level safety is delegated to the workload's **PodDisruptionBudget** and replica headroom:

- With a strict PDB (e.g., `minAvailable` equal to the desired replica count), the Eviction API blocks further evictions until replacement Pods are `Ready`. Because the surge node provides the capacity for those replacements to schedule and become `Ready`, the drain effectively becomes Pod-level make-before-break.
- With a loose or absent PDB, evictions proceed in bulk and `readyReplicas` dips (§4.1).

In short: the controller guarantees a node-level surge; **Pod-level make-before-break is achieved by PDB + replica headroom, which the surge node's capacity enables — not by the controller itself** (consistent with G4).

### Stateful and zonal workloads — matching the replacement node's requirements

Because surge only **adds capacity** and never pins Pods to the new node (above), the rescheduled Pods land wherever the scheduler can place them. A Pod bound to a **zonal** PersistentVolume — EBS `gp3`/`io2`, or any volume whose PV carries a `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` `nodeAffinity` — can only reschedule onto a node in the **same AZ** as its volume. If the surge node is provisioned in a *different* AZ, that Pod has nowhere to land and stays `Pending` after the old node drains — defeating make-before-break for exactly the stateful workloads that need it most.

The placeholder therefore replicates the **candidate node's scheduling requirements**, not merely the NodePool's labels. **Which** requirements are replicated is **configurable** via `surge.matchNodeRequirements` (§5.4): each listed key is copied from the candidate node onto the placeholder — either as a **`required`** (hard `nodeAffinity` / `nodeSelector`, value = the candidate's) or a **`preferred`** (soft `nodeAffinity`, relaxed under capacity pressure) constraint.

- The default `required` set is **`topology.kubernetes.io/zone`** — pinning the surge node to the candidate's AZ so the existing EBS volume can re-attach — plus **`kubernetes.io/arch`** and **`karpenter.sh/capacity-type`** for arch/capacity parity. This is enough for zonal-PV rebind without pinning the exact instance type, which would needlessly shrink the schedulable pool and make same-AZ capacity harder to find.
- Operators add keys for stricter parity — e.g. `node.kubernetes.io/instance-type` (or family) for exact-type parity, or any custom node label the workload's `nodeAffinity` / `nodeSelector` / `topologySpreadConstraints` depend on — or move keys to `preferred` to trade strictness for schedulability.

The configured keys are read from the candidate `NodeClaim`'s `spec.requirements` and the candidate node's labels, **intersected with the NodePool's allowed requirements** — the intersection keeps the placeholder schedulable within the NodePool even if the NodePool template has since narrowed its allowed set (otherwise a now-disallowed candidate label would leave the placeholder unschedulable forever, tripping `readyTimeout` and rolling back). A key listed in config but absent on the candidate node is skipped. **Validation:** removing `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` from `required` **warns** — zonal-PV Pods may then strand if the surge node lands in another AZ.

This only re-creates a **same-AZ landing zone**; it does **not** move storage. The CSI driver re-attaches the existing zonal volume to the new node in that AZ once the replacement Pod is scheduled there. Cross-AZ migration of zonal storage is out of scope — surge neither can nor should do it. (Implication: if the candidate node's AZ has no schedulable capacity for a same-zone replacement, the surge cannot complete and rolls back via `readyTimeout` (§3.3 *Rollback*); the old node is left in place and the `expireAfter` backstop still applies. NodePools fronting zonal-PV workloads should ensure each in-use AZ retains surge headroom — see R3.)

### Rollback behavior

| Failure | Action |
|---------|--------|
| New node not `Ready` within timeout | **Explicitly delete the surge NodeClaim the placeholder induced when one is identifiable, then delete the placeholder — in that order**: the placeholder's bind/nominate target *is* the identification, and it is lost once the placeholder is gone. Only a NodeClaim **created after this rotation's `started-at`** qualifies for the reap — on the capacity-absorb path the placeholder is bound to a *pre-existing* node, which is healthy production capacity, never surge debris, and must never be reaped. The resolved claim name is **persisted to the old NodeClaim (`noderotation.io/surge-claim`) before the reap acts on it**, so a crash after the placeholder is deleted but before the failed state lands does not orphan the induced claim — the next pass re-reads the annotation and re-issues the idempotent delete. Consolidation is *not* relied on to reap the induced claim: on a NodePool where consolidation is effectively disabled (e.g. `WhenEmpty` with a long `consolidateAfter`, or `nodes: "0"` budgets outside the window) an abandoned surge node would otherwise stay billed until its own `expireAfter`. Remove `do-not-disrupt` from **every node carrying this rotation's `surge-for` marker** — the old node, plus the surge target if a crash had already frozen it (symmetric with the completion handler); leave the old node in place; emit failure metric + alert |
| New node becomes `NotReady` after old one was deleted | The old node's drain is already in flight and cannot be reversed; rely on Karpenter to reconcile capacity for the rescheduled pods |
| Karpenter API unavailable | Skip; the next reconcile retries |
| Controller dies mid-surge | The rotation resumes exactly from the `noderotation.io/active-rotation` anchor on the NodePool (§5.2 step 1); every state handler re-asserts its phase's side effects idempotently, so a freeze, placeholder, or delete lost to the crash is restored on the next reconcile. A startup sweep additionally clears markers that no anchor references (the precise staleness rule is in §5.3) |

> v1 processes one node per cycle. If the maintenance window is too short to accommodate all candidates, the unprocessed ones roll over to the next window. The `expireAfter` backstop ensures eventual rotation (in the forceful path) even in pathological cases.

## 3.4 Future versions (v2 / v3)

The v1 design intentionally stops short of application-level concerns. The following are reserved expansion points.

| Version | Addition | Trigger for adoption |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| v1 | Surge + sequential delete | Initial release |
| v2 | Image pre-pull job pinned to the replacement node before deleting the old one | Observed image-pull latency on cold replacement nodes |
| v3 | Synthetic-traffic warm-up job (e.g., JVM JIT priming) before deleting the old one | Observed 5xx spikes after replacement that `readinessGate` alone does not absorb |

The configuration schema in §5.4 already includes placeholder fields for v2 and v3.

## 3.5 Backstop Behavior

If the controller is unavailable, the following safety net engages in order:

1. Karpenter Consolidation / Drift may still rotate some nodes (e.g., on AMI drift)
2. NodePool `expireAfter` triggers Forceful drain on overdue nodes
3. NodePool `terminationGracePeriod` bounds the drain
4. The Auto Mode 21-day hard cap is the final ceiling

> **Important**: backstop paths 2–4 are forceful — PDBs are respected only until `terminationGracePeriod` expires. Extended controller downtime restores the original risk profile. A **stale `karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt`** left on a node by a controller that crashed mid-surge does **not** change this: node-level `do-not-disrupt` suppresses only voluntary disruption (path 1), **not** `expireAfter` (path 2), so path 2 still fires on schedule and the node cannot outlive its `deadline`. The startup sweep clears the stale marker, but the marker was never extending the node's life in the first place.

> **Graceful degradation — never worse than the status quo.** Every failure mode degrades onto Karpenter's native Forceful Expiration (path 2). If a rotation fails, a maintenance window is missed, or the controller is absent entirely, the node is still expired and drained by `expireAfter` **exactly as it would be without this controller** — including the residual risk in §3.3 where a deadline reached mid-surge force-expires the old node before the replacement is `Ready` (forceful, but identical to the no-controller baseline). The controller only ever moves rotation *earlier* and makes it *graceful*; by design it never removes the safety net and — because node-level `do-not-disrupt` has no effect on `expireAfter` — it can never extend a node's life beyond `expireAfter` either. So the **worst case equals today's baseline** — forceful, but bounded — which is precisely why the design is safe to adopt incrementally and why the §3.2 lead time is sized to win the race in the *normal* case rather than depended on for safety in the *failure* case.

## 4.1 Capacity / Availability

| Concern | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| Pod pending time during rotation | Approaches zero thanks to surge (matches Karpenter Graceful semantics) |
| `readyReplicas` dipping below the desired count | A structural Kubernetes limitation when pods leave via the Eviction API — even with surge, the new pod isn't `Ready` instantly. Mitigation belongs at the application layer (over-provision replicas + PDB) and is not in scope here |
| Concurrent surge nodes | v1 is fixed at `surge.maxUnavailable = 1` **per NodePool** (serial within a NodePool; distinct NodePools may surge concurrently). The replacement node is **NodePool-owned** (induced via the placeholder Pod, see §3.3). Note that `spec.limits` is a **resource budget** (`{cpu, memory, …}`), **not** a node count — so the actual precondition is that the placeholder's requests (the surge node's resource footprint, §3.3) fit within the NodePool's *remaining* budget (`limits − currently-provisioned`), alongside any external EC2 vCPU quota. Intuitively this is "+1 node over baseline," but it is enforced as a **resource** check, not a count. The controller **pre-checks this headroom before starting a rotation** (§5.2) and skips with a warning if the remaining budget cannot fit one more node's worth of resources. `maxUnavailable > 1` is reserved for a later version and would require headroom for `m` nodes |

## 4.2 Observability

Prometheus metrics exposed on `/metrics`:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Purpose |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| `noderotation_candidates` | Gauge | `nodepool` | Eligible NodeClaim count |
| `noderotation_in_progress` | Gauge | `nodepool` | Active rotation count |
| `noderotation_completed_total` | Counter | `nodepool`, `outcome` | Cumulative completions; outcome ∈ {success, failure, expired} — `expired` = the old NodeClaim vanished out of `pending` (force-expired mid-surge, §5.2; never counted as success) |
| `noderotation_duration_seconds` | Histogram | `nodepool`, `phase` | Per-phase duration; phase ∈ {surge_wait, drain} |
| `noderotation_window_active` | Gauge | — | 0/1 indicator of window membership |
| `noderotation_freeze_until_timestamp` | Gauge | `nodepool` | Unix timestamp of active freeze (0 = no freeze) |
| `noderotation_age_threshold_seconds` | Gauge | `nodepool` | Derived `ageThreshold` (§3.2) |
| `noderotation_rotation_chances` | Gauge | `nodepool` | Guaranteed rotation chances `G` for the derived threshold |
| `noderotation_window_period_seconds` | Gauge | `nodepool` | Worst-case window period `P` of the schedule union |
| `noderotation_short_lead_nodes` | Gauge | `nodepool` | NodeClaims whose **own** `spec.expireAfter` can no longer guarantee `K` chances (per-node `A ≤ 0`; §3.2 layer 3) |
| `noderotation_drain_stuck` | Gauge | `nodepool` | 0/1: the in-flight rotation's drain has exceeded `tGP + buffer` (§5.2) |
| `noderotation_retry_count` | Gauge | `nodepool` | Highest `noderotation.io/retry-count` (§5.3) across the NodePool's NodeClaims (0 when none) — the systematic-failure signal; annotations alone cannot feed Prometheus alerts |

> **Label note.** `noderotation_window_period_seconds` carries a `nodepool` label, but in v1 the maintenance window is **cluster-wide** (`maintenanceWindows` is a single union, §3.1) — so `P` is identical across all NodePools and this metric reports the same value for every `nodepool`. The label is **forward-looking**: it is retained so the series shape stays stable when per-NodePool windows land (§7.3 Open Question 2). By contrast `noderotation_age_threshold_seconds` and `noderotation_rotation_chances` *already* vary per NodePool in v1 — they fold in each NodePool's representative `expireAfter`/`terminationGracePeriod` — so their `nodepool` label is load-bearing today; and `noderotation_window_active` is deliberately label-free because window *membership* is a single cluster-wide truth in v1.

Suggested alerts:

- `increase(noderotation_completed_total{outcome=~"failure|expired"}[1h]) > 0`
- `noderotation_candidates > 0` for two consecutive windows (controller falling behind)
- `noderotation_window_active == 1` for the full window with zero completions and non-zero candidates
- `noderotation_drain_stuck == 1` (drain blocked past `tGP + buffer` — blocking PDB or stuck finalizer; §5.2)
- `noderotation_short_lead_nodes > 0` (NodeClaims whose stamped `expireAfter` can no longer guarantee `K` chances; §3.2 layer 3)
- `noderotation_retry_count >= 3` (the same rotation keeps failing — systematic cause such as sustained placeholder preemption or same-AZ capacity shortage; §5.3)

## 4.3 RBAC and Cloud Permissions

### Kubernetes RBAC

```yaml
- apiGroups: ["karpenter.sh"]
  resources: ["nodeclaims"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
- apiGroups: ["karpenter.sh"]
  resources: ["nodepools"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["nodes"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "patch"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["events"]
  verbs: ["create", "patch"]
- apiGroups: ["coordination.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["leases"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```

### Cloud (e.g., AWS) IAM

v1 performs no direct cloud API calls. All operations route through Karpenter via the `NodeClaim` CRD.

v2 (image pre-pull) and v3 (synthetic warm-up) Jobs run as pods on the new node and inherit that node's role; no extra controller-level cloud permissions are introduced.

## 4.4 Cost

Each rotation creates a brief overlap during which both the old and new nodes are billed. Order of magnitude per rotation: 10–20 minutes of one extra on-demand instance. For weekly rotation of N nodes, additional cost is `≈ N × 4 × hourly_rate × 0.25` per month, which is small relative to baseline node cost. Because rotation is serial *per NodePool* but concurrent *across* NodePools (§3.3), peak overlap — and thus peak instantaneous extra cost — scales with the number of NodePools rotating at the same time. A **failed** surge attempt can also briefly bill a surge node (up to `readyTimeout`, after which it is explicitly reaped — §3.3 *Rollback*); the escalating `retryBackoff` (§5.3) bounds how often a systematically failing rotation (e.g. sustained placeholder preemption, persistent same-AZ capacity shortage) can repeat that cost.

## 5.2 Reconcile Loop

Implemented with [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime). The reconciler watches `NodeClaim` and runs a periodic Ticker to detect window edges and freeze releases.

Each `Reconcile` call performs **exactly one non-blocking step** and returns a `Requeue`. There are **no blocking waits** (the 15-minute surge wait and the drain wait are *elapsed-time checks* against the `started-at`/deletion timestamps, re-evaluated on later reconciles), so a worker is never held and progress survives controller restarts — all state is read back from annotations (§5.3). Serial processing is enforced by handling any in-flight rotation *before* starting a new one.

```text
Reconcile(req):                              # req is a NodeClaim event or a periodic Tick
  if req is Tick:                            # a Tick is not tied to one object
      for np in in_scope_nodepools():        #   → fan out over every selected NodePool
          reconcile_nodepool(np)
      return Requeue(1m)
  return reconcile_nodepool(nodepool(req.obj))

reconcile_nodepool(np):
  # ── 1. Drive the in-flight rotation first (serial: at most one per NodePool).
  #       Keyed on the NodePool's active-rotation ANCHOR, not on finding an annotated
  #       NodeClaim — the old NodeClaim disappears when the rotation succeeds, and the
  #       completion side effects below must still run after that.

```

`pick_oldest_eligible` selects claims whose `state` is empty (fresh) or `failed` with `now − failed-at` past the escalated backoff (`retryBackoff · 2^(retry-count − 1)`, capped at 8×); `pending`/`draining` claims are never re-selected (they are driven by step 1). Re-selecting a `failed` claim writes the anchor and lands in the `failed` case of `advance()`, which performs the actual `failed → pending` re-entry by resetting `state` — `started-at` was cleared by the failed write, so the new attempt re-stamps its own `readyTimeout` deadline (with `retryBackoff` ≥ `readyTimeout` — true of the defaults, 30m vs 15m; §3.2 warns otherwise — a retry that inherited the old timestamp would fail instantly without ever creating a placeholder). Without that reset there would be no executable path for the §5.3 `failed → pending` transition at all: every reconcile would re-select the claim, write the anchor, fall into the anchor-clearing crash-recovery branch, and loop — starving every other candidate in the NodePool. Leader election uses the standard `coordination.k8s.io/Lease`; on leader change the new leader resumes purely from annotations.

Step 1 keys on the **NodePool's `active-rotation` anchor**, not on finding an annotated NodeClaim: the old NodeClaim — the carrier of the per-rotation `state` — is deleted when the rotation succeeds, so any discovery that depends on it would go blind at exactly the moment the completion side effects (placeholder removal, surge-target unfreeze, `last-rotation-at`) must run. The anchor is written **before** any other side effect at start and cleared **last** at completion/failure, so every crash point leaves a resumable record. The completion **outcome** is decided by the NodePool-side phase mirror `active-rotation-state`: written (immediately before the controller's `delete`) when the rotation enters `draining`, it is the only durable record of how far the rotation had progressed once the old NodeClaim is gone — a controller-driven drain completes as `success` (cooldown consumed), while a claim that vanished out of `pending` (force-expired mid-surge, §3.3 residual risk) is recorded as `expired` with an alert and **no** cooldown: counting an un-rotated node as success would silence the failure alerts and delay the next genuine rotation. Complementarily, each state handler is an **idempotent re-assertion** of its phase's desired state rather than a one-shot action: the pending handler re-asserts the old node's freeze and the placeholder's existence on every pass (a crash between any two start-time side effects heals on the next reconcile), and the draining handler re-issues the idempotent `delete` when the old NodeClaim has no `deletionTimestamp` (a crash between the state write and the delete would otherwise hang the rotation forever — the handler would be waiting for a deletion nobody requested).

Two narrow observability skews are accepted in v1 rather than engineered away. **Mislabeled force-expiry in the mirror-to-delete gap:** the phase mirror is written immediately *before* the controller's `delete`, so a crash in that gap, followed by the old node force-expiring during the outage, is still recorded as `success` — by that point `surge_ready` had already held (the replacement capacity was reserved), so the practical outcome matches a controller-driven drain; only the label is off, and the exposure is a single reconcile step landing right before an outage. **At-least-once / at-most-once metric emission:** metric writes are not transactional with the annotation updates. The completion handler emits before clearing the anchor, so a crash between the two replays the completion and can double-count `success`/`expired` (at-least-once); the failure path emits after the failed-state write, so a crash between the two loses at most that one `failure` increment (at-most-once) — the `failed` state and the `noderotation_retry_count` gauge survive on the claim, so a systematic failure still alerts. Alert rules built on `increase(...)` over a window tolerate both skews.

A drain that exceeds `drain_bound` (= `tGP + buffer`; a fixed default, e.g. `1h`, when `tGP` is unset — see the §3.2 layer-1 warning) raises the stuck-drain alert (`noderotation_drain_stuck`, §4.2) but deliberately **keeps the serial gate held**: a rotation in `draining` cannot be rolled back (the old NodeClaim already carries a `deletionTimestamp`), and releasing the gate would start disrupting a second node while the first is still half-drained, violating `maxUnavailable = 1`. Remediation is operator-side — resolve the blocking PDB or stuck finalizer; when `tGP` is set, Karpenter ultimately forces the drain on its own.

The `cooldownAfter` gate in step 2 anchors on `noderotation.io/last-rotation-at`, written on the **NodePool** at each successful completion. It is **not** carried on the old NodeClaim: that object — the carrier of per-rotation state — is deleted when the rotation completes, so a requeue keyed on it would be a no-op (the reason the previous `Requeue(cooldown=…)` on the deleted claim did not actually enforce a pause; instead the next Tick could start a rotation immediately). Anchoring on the surviving NodePool makes the pause durable across the completion boundary and across leader changes. The gate is evaluated *per NodePool*, matching the per-NodePool serial model (distinct NodePools still rotate concurrently).

## 5.3 State Model

Progress state lives entirely on Kubernetes objects (the NodePool, the old `NodeClaim`, the two nodes, and the transient placeholder Pod) — **no external datastore** is required. Durable truth is split across two carriers: the NodePool's `active-rotation` anchor records **which** rotation is in flight (and survives the old NodeClaim's deletion on success), with `active-rotation-state` mirroring whether it reached `draining` — the record that lets the completion handler pick the right outcome after the old NodeClaim is gone — while the old NodeClaim's `state` annotation records **where** that rotation is. The placeholder Pod and the node markers are runtime objects that the idempotent handlers (§5.2) re-create or re-assert from those two if lost.

| Key | Target | Value | Purpose |
|-----|--------|-------|---------|
| `noderotation.io/active-rotation` | NodePool | Old NodeClaim's `metadata.name` | **Durable anchor** for the in-flight rotation; drives §5.2 step 1 and — because it outlives the old NodeClaim — the completion handler. Written before any other side effect at start, cleared last at completion/failure. Also the per-NodePool serial gate |
| `noderotation.io/active-rotation-state` | NodePool | `draining` | Phase mirror for the anchored rotation, written immediately **before** the controller's `delete` of the old NodeClaim; absence means the rotation never left `pending`. Read by the completion handler — after the old NodeClaim (the `state` carrier) is gone — to pick the outcome: `draining` → `success` + cooldown; absent → `expired` + alert, no cooldown (§5.2). Cleared in the same update as the anchor on **both** the completion and the failure path (same object → atomic) |
| `noderotation.io/state` | Old NodeClaim | `pending` / `draining` / `failed` | Progress state of the anchored rotation |
| `noderotation.io/started-at` | Old NodeClaim | RFC3339 timestamp | `readyTimeout` deadline + observability. Write-once **per attempt**: cleared by the failed write — a **single update** together with `state=failed`/`failed-at`/`retry-count` (§5.2), so no crash can leave a torn intermediate — and re-stamped by the retry (otherwise, `retryBackoff` ≥ `readyTimeout` — true of the defaults; §3.2 warns when violated — would make every retry time out instantly) |
| `noderotation.io/failed-at` | Old NodeClaim | RFC3339 timestamp | Backoff anchor for re-selection after a failure |
| `noderotation.io/retry-count` | Old NodeClaim | integer | Consecutive failures of this claim; escalates the backoff (`retryBackoff · 2^(retry-count − 1)`, capped at 8×) and is surfaced as the `noderotation_retry_count` gauge (§4.2), which feeds the systematic-failure alert |
| `noderotation.io/surge-claim` | Old NodeClaim | Induced surge NodeClaim's `metadata.name` | Written on the failure path **before** the reap acts, while the placeholder — whose bind/nominate target is the only other source of this identity — still exists; keeps the reap target identifiable if a crash separates the placeholder deletion from the failed-state write (§3.3 *Rollback*). Cleared in the same update as the failed write |
| `noderotation.io/surge-for` | Placeholder Pod **and** each controller-frozen node | Old NodeClaim's `metadata.name` | Pairing and ownership: finds/cleans up the placeholder; resolves the **surge target** at completion after the old NodeClaim is gone; marks a `do-not-disrupt` as controller-applied (vs operator-applied) for the sweep |
| `karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt` | Old node + surge target node | `true` | Blocks Karpenter **voluntary disruption only** (Consolidation/Drift/Emptiness) during the surge — **not** `expireAfter`, Interruption, or Node Repair (§3.3). Always set together with `noderotation.io/surge-for`; removed at the end; a stale value does not extend node life (see §3.5) |
| `noderotation.io/freeze` | NodePool | RFC3339 timestamp (freeze-until) | Suppresses rotation until the given time |
| `noderotation.io/last-rotation-at` | NodePool | RFC3339 timestamp | Completion time of the NodePool's last rotation; the `cooldownAfter` start-gate anchor (§5.2 step 2). Lives on the **NodePool** because the old NodeClaim that carries per-rotation state is deleted on success, so the pause must survive that deletion |

### State transitions

The old NodeClaim's `noderotation.io/state` drives the machine in §5.2, anchored by the NodePool's `active-rotation`. Crash recovery rests on two rules rather than on annotation order alone: the **anchor brackets the rotation** (written first, cleared last), and **every handler idempotently re-asserts its phase's side effects** — so a crash between any two writes is healed on the next reconcile instead of leaving a half-applied step behind.

| From | Event | To | Side effects |
|------|-------|----|--------------|
| *(none)* | selected in window | `pending` | write NodePool `active-rotation` anchor (first); freeze old node (`do-not-disrupt` + `surge-for`); create placeholder (hostname `NotIn` exclusion of the old node and near-deadline hosts, §3.3) |
| `pending` | each reconcile (recovery) | `pending` | re-assert old-node freeze; recreate missing placeholder (only while `readyTimeout` has not elapsed — the timeout is checked first, §5.2) |
| `pending` | placeholder Running on Ready host ≠ old node | `draining` | freeze surge target (`do-not-disrupt` + `surge-for`); write NodePool `active-rotation-state=draining` (before the delete); `delete` old NodeClaim |
| `pending` | `readyTimeout` elapsed | `failed` | persist the induced claim's name to `surge-claim` (resolved from the placeholder's bind target **before** the placeholder is deleted; only claims created after `started-at` — §3.3 *Rollback*), then reap it; delete placeholder; unfreeze node(s) carrying `surge-for`; one update: `state=failed`, `failed-at`, `retry-count += 1`, clear `started-at` + `surge-claim`; emit failure + alert; clear anchor + `active-rotation-state` (last) |
| `pending` | old NodeClaim gone (force-expired mid-surge, §3.3) | *(aborted)* | delete placeholder; unfreeze node(s) carrying `surge-for`; emit `expired` + alert; **no** `last-rotation-at` (nothing was rotated → no cooldown); clear anchor + `active-rotation-state` (last) |
| `draining` | old NodeClaim has no `deletionTimestamp` (recovery) | `draining` | re-issue the idempotent `delete` |
| `draining` | drain exceeds `tGP + buffer` | `draining` (stuck) | one-shot stuck-drain alert (`noderotation_drain_stuck`); the serial gate stays held on purpose — see §5.2 |
| `draining` | old NodeClaim gone | *(completed)* | delete placeholder; unfreeze node(s) carrying `surge-for`; write `last-rotation-at`; clear anchor + `active-rotation-state` (last); emit success |
| `failed` | escalated backoff elapsed, still in window, NodePool not frozen | `pending` | the `failed` case of `advance()` resets `state` to `pending` (§5.2) — `retry-count` retained, `started-at` re-stamped by the new attempt. A re-entry is a **new** attempt, not an in-flight continuation, so it honors the same window/freeze gates as step 2; the `expireAfter` backstop covers repeated failure |

`pending` and `draining` are **driven by step 1** of §5.2 and are never re-picked as fresh candidates; this is also what enforces serial (`surge.maxUnavailable = 1`) processing. A completed rotation leaves no per-claim state because the old NodeClaim — the carrier of those annotations — is deleted; the NodePool keeps only `last-rotation-at`.

**Startup sweep — staleness rule.** A NodePool whose `active-rotation` anchor is set is **not** stale: step 1 resumes it on the first reconcile (that is the normal recovery path, not the sweep's job). The sweep cleans only markers that **no anchor references**: placeholder Pods whose `surge-for` claim no longer exists or is not anchored are deleted; node markers likewise have `noderotation.io/surge-for` *and* the accompanying `karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt` removed. The sweep strips `do-not-disrupt` **only** from nodes that also carry the controller's own `surge-for` marker — an operator-applied `do-not-disrupt` (no marker) is never touched. `failed` claims keep their annotations (they drive backoff re-entry and are not stale). A `pending`/`draining` claim in a NodePool with no anchor cannot result from any crash point (the anchor is written first and cleared last); if observed anyway (manual edit), it is set to `failed` and alerted. Likewise an `active-rotation-state` with no accompanying anchor (also impossible from any crash point — the two are cleared in a single update on the same object) is simply removed.

## 7.1 Risks

| # | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|------|------------|
| R1 | Controller pod crashes / leader loss | `replicas=2` with leader election; the `expireAfter` backstop is retained; failure metrics alert |
| R2 | Maintenance window too short to drain all candidates | The §3.2 throughput check warns up front; alert on `noderotation_candidates` failing to decrease for two consecutive windows; consider `maxUnavailable > 1` in a later version |
| R3 | Surge NodeClaim cannot be launched (capacity / AZ shortage / NodePool `limits` resource budget exhausted) | The controller pre-checks NodePool `limits` resource-budget headroom before starting (§5.2) and warns if the placeholder's requests won't fit; ready-timeout triggers rollback otherwise; NodePool should already permit multi-AZ / multi-instance-type. **Zonal caveat:** the surge node is pinned to the candidate's AZ for zonal-PV rebind (§3.3 *Stateful and zonal workloads*), so a same-AZ capacity shortage cannot fall back to another zone — keep per-AZ surge headroom for NodePools fronting zonal-PV workloads |
| R4 | Drain blocks on a misconfigured PDB | Karpenter's `terminationGracePeriod` ultimately forces drain; PDB review is the application owner's responsibility |
| R5 | Forgotten freeze during business-critical period | The freeze annotation is meant to be managed declaratively (e.g., via GitOps) rather than ad-hoc |
| R6 | Verification gap when test clusters routinely turn over (e.g., nightly shutdown) | Disable shutdown for a soak period that exceeds the age threshold to validate end-to-end rotation |

| A standalone (non-NodePool-owned) `NodeClaim` is *provisionable* on EKS Auto Mode | **Validated** — K8s 1.35, `karpenter.sh/v1` (2026-05-29) | A NodeClaim with only `nodeClassRef` (managed `eks.amazonaws.com/NodeClass`) + `requirements` reached `Ready` (real EC2, node registered) in ~30s; admission accepted it (`--dry-run=server`); graceful finalizer-driven deletion confirmed |

> **Why this is recorded as a capability, not the surge mechanism.** The standalone-NodeClaim result proves Karpenter will honor a controller-created NodeClaim, which de-risks the project. But the surge design (§3.3) deliberately does **not** use it: a standalone node is unowned by any NodePool, so pods would persist on a node outside NodePool accounting/expiry/drift/budgets, breaking intentional NodePool separation. It is kept as a documented **fallback** should the placeholder approach prove unworkable.
>
> **Not yet validated (PoC scope):** the *primary* mechanism — inducing a NodePool-owned node via a placeholder Pod sized to the candidate node's *reschedulable* Pod requests (§3.3 exclusions: DaemonSet / mirror / completed / node-pinned), applying `karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt` to both nodes during the surge to fend off **voluntary** Consolidation/Drift, and confirming that explicit NodeClaim deletion drains the old node through the voluntary (PDB-respecting) path, plus that a preempted bare placeholder Pod (running under its dedicated negative `PriorityClass`, `preemptionPolicy: Never`) is deleted without re-pending, that an unrelated higher-priority preemption mid-surge is bounded by `readyTimeout` → rollback (§3.3 *Placeholder priority*), and that a bin-packed placeholder genuinely reserves existing capacity for the drain (capacity-absorb path, §3.3). These are the first PoC items. (That `do-not-disrupt` does **not** block `expireAfter` is *not* an open PoC question — it is documented Karpenter behavior, confirmed in the `nodeclaim/expiration` controller source; §3.3. The design relies on `leadTime` sizing, not the annotation, to win the expiration race.)

## 7.3 Open Questions

1. **Migration to CRD-based policy** if multiple NodePools require divergent rotation policies
2. **Per-NodePool window** vs single cluster-wide window
3. **Holiday-aware scheduling** (skip rotation if `Sat` falls on a holiday). The v1 design intentionally ignores holidays
4. **Pre-pull image source provisioning** for v2 — whether to use the standard Karpenter NodeClass image-pulling capability or a dedicated Job
5. **Multi-cloud verification** (AKS NAP, GKE) before claiming compatibility beyond EKS Auto Mode
